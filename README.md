# Armlist

We have worked with K2 on an updated contract and moving forward they will be cleaning, duplicating, and sharing data with us on a quarterly basis. As of July 2020, we have data from January 2018 through June 2020.

Since all files are huge and can't be opened in the Excel file, I will open it using Python for Data Cleaning.

This issue will show any errors or issues and decision points.
